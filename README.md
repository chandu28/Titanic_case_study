# Titanic_case_study
Analysis of titanic data set and my predictions 

# I have used algorithms which I am familiar of in this analysis in R code and later tried my exploratory analysis and logistic regression in Python and checked its perfomance by submitting in kaggle and gave the best as my final submission

# Problem statement

This data deals about predicted the people who survived in the tiatnic ship disaster.The target variable is whether a person survived or not. So it comes in classifer problem where the target value is Discrete rather than real value where regressor is commonly used.

# Datasets

The data which is required for this problem statement is provided in the data folder along with sample submission file

# Process

#import the train data
#carry out exploratory analysis
           univariate, bivariate, multivariate
           
#check out skew, normal distribution and other plots and graphs based on the data and the features 
#Check out missing values 
#impute them with most likely hood method or amelai incase of R or any method of imputation
#Label the categorical value incase of python language used as the ML algorithm doesnt understand humaqn language it can just understand machine language just as numbers
#Use cross validation method incase of R for better perfomance of model evaluation and use test train split incase of Python for cheking the perfomance within train and later compare thenm with test data
#Fit the model
#Predict the target value and evaluate based on the target value of train data and try to carryout in test also and find the output by submission in Kaggle
